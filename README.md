# DiplomaArchiveAndroid
Django And React Native Project

Django Rest API 
React Native Expo

Android application to store diplomas that students can provide by uploading them in pdf format. This provided students the ability to request an exemption for a particular course based on the competences per diploma.
The API will take care of both saving and reading the pdf.
Employees or teachers can alter the competences and assign competences to diplomas and courses, they also have the ability to verify compliance and therefore approve or reject a request.
