# DiplomaArchiveAndroid

Django Rest API  
React Native Expo

Android application to store diplomas that students can provide by uploading them in pdf format. This provides students the ability to request an exemption for a particular course based on the competences per diploma.
The API will take care of both the saving and reading of the pdf, the latter is for keyword recognition.
Employees or teachers can alter and assign competences to diplomas and courses, while also having the ability to verify compliance and therefore approve or reject a request.
